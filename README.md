# Fork Sync
[![Build](https://github.com/r0ps3c/fork-sync/workflows/PR%20Checks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/r0ps3c/fork-sync/actions?workflow=PR%20Checks)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/r0ps3c/fork-sync?style=flat-square)

Github action to sync your Forks.
This action uses octokit and the GitHub API to automatically create and merge a pull request with the head defined by `head` into the base defined by `base`. The head branch owner is defined by `owner`. If you create a PR in the same repository you can omit the `owner` parameter.

# Example Workflow

```yml
name: Sync Fork

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *' # every 30 minutes
  workflow_dispatch: # on button click

jobs:
  sync:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: r0ps3c/fork-sync@v2
        with:
          owner: llvm
          base: master
          head: master
```

## Auto approve

If you use a workflow which does not allow to merge pull requests without a review 
("Require pull request reviews before merging" in your [repo settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository))
you can set `auto_approve` to `true`. In that case you'll have to provide a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
for a user which is allowed to review the pull requests changes. Make sure the token has at least
`public_repo` permissions and store the token inside of the [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

An example workflow would then look like this:

```yml
name: Sync Fork

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *' # every 30 minutes
  workflow_dispatch: # on button click

jobs:
  sync:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: r0ps3c/fork-sync@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
          owner: llvm
          base: master
          head: master
```

Notes:
⚠️ $current_repo_owner is your own username!

⚠️ Only provide the branch name for `head` and `base`. `user:branch` will not work! 

⚠️ If `auto_approve` is set to `true` you must provide a personal access token in `token` the default github token won't work!
